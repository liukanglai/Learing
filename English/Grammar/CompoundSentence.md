        Romance has evaporated, and on the contrary she still misses the past.

        There remain an army of companies coming from afar, and consequently, I feel more than delighted.
        I am claimed changedable like water. By contrast, my clarity keeps consistent.

2. 完形填空

- 只需要读懂逻辑关系词前后两句话的意思就 ok

- 翻译时对照前后找省略成分非常实用！！！
